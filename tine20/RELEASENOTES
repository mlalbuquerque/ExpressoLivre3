  7. ActiveSync improvements

- The handling of the synckey has been improved. Resets of the sync data should happen at a much lower rate now.

- You can now add or reactivate an admin user and set or reset the password via the setup CLI.
 usage example:
 
     $ php setup.php --create_admin
    Please enter a username. If the user already exists, he is reactivated and you can reset the password.
    
    Username> existingAdmin
    User existingAdmin already exists.
    Activated admin user 'existingAdmin' (expires tomorrow).
    
    Do you want to reset the password (default: "no", "y" or "yes" for reset)?> y
    
    Admin user password> 
    
    Confirm password> 
    User password has been reset.
    
9. Calendar Frontend JSON API change
-----------------

- A small API change took place in Calendar/Frontend/Json.php:
 All occurrences of the function parameter "checkBusyConficts" have been replaced by the correct "checkBusyConflicts".
 
 10. Improved search / filtering options
 -----------------
 
 - The filtertoolbar has been extended to support OR filtering and it is now possible to filter in related records
 and the relations themselves. For example you could search for contacts that are attender of events that are scheduled
 this week and whose attender status is 'Tentative'.
