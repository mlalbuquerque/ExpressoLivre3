Production use of git master WARNING
-----------------------------------

Do not use the Tine 2.0 git master on a production server:
The master should be seen as a development code and *not* suitable for production use.

Production servers should only run the official Tine 2.0 releases from http://www.tine20.org/download.

The Tine 2.0 git master branch
- will contain new features that have only undergone limited testing and may corrupt data and/or return incorrect results.
- may create database formats/tables that are not upgradable to future releases of Tine 2.0. Databases created by official Tine 2.0 releases will be upgradable to future versions.
- may not supply update scripts for database or other changes. It might be necessary to uninstall and reinstall applications for the changes to take effect.

Nevertheless we highly appreciate testing of the git master and user feedback and/or bugreports:
You can send bugreports via 
- the build in bugreporting tool.
- the forum (http://www.tine20.org/forum).
- the bugtracker (http://forge.tine20.org/mantisbt/index.php).

We also like to have your feedback to new features and suggestions for improvements. You may put these in our forum at http://www.tine20.org/forum as well.

Now go and have fun with Tine 2.0 ... :)
