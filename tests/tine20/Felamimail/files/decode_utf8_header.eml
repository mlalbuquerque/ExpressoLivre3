Just an idea without knowing all the details:
Could

 - "--emerge-info" and "--emerge-info-verbose"
   options be added to paludis or

 - a converter script be written to convert
   paludis output to feel like emerge output

to solves this issue?  Would that technically
be possible?  Is paludis returning a superset
of the information returned by portage?
